# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques in Python. It is based on the California Housing dataset and employs a Linear Regression model for prediction. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to process and analyze housing data to predict prices effectively.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas - for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy - for numerical operations
- Matplotlib - for data visualization
- Scikit-learn - for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset, which includes features like median income, housing median age, average rooms, average bedrooms, population, average occupancy, latitude, and longitude of the block group.

## Features of the Project
- Data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for model training.
- Feature selection to identify the most relevant variables.
- Model training using the Linear Regression algorithm.
- Evaluation of the model using Mean Squared Error.
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices to assess model performance.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Install the required packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
4. Run the script `house_price_prediction.ipynb`.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. A scatter plot is also generated to visually compare the actual and predicted house prices.
